Therefore, this course will discuss how to handle this problem with SAE.\nThe course starts from the fundamental principles of SAE and progresses to its advanced model extensions, including spatial, spatiotemporal, bivariate, and multivariate models.\nAnother key component of the course is to explore the Generalized SAE (GSAE) approach, which builds upon the generalized direct survey estimates (GDESvy), incorporating the survey independent variables.\nParticipants will learn the basic concepts of SAE, and its statistical model extensions in the Fay-Herriot model framework.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nParticipants will have a basic concept of:\n\nSampling techniques\n\nSpatial and spatio-temporal models\n\nBivariate and multivariate models\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:\n\nBriefly understand the basic concepts and principle of SAE.\n\nLearn about the extension models of SAE, including spatial, and spatiotemporal bivariate and multivariate models and examine how these extended models improved the SAE approach.\n\nPresent the recently introduced concepts of GSAE and understand how incorporating independent survey variables can improve the results.\n\nPresent how the generalized models, i.e., GSAE and GDESvy, improved the performance of the corresponding SAE and DESvy.\n\n\nAbout the Instructors\n\nSeyifemickael Amare Yilema\nPost-doctoral Fellow in Biostatistics, Department of Statistics, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa\nAssistant Professor of Statistics, Debre Tabor University, Ethiopia\nProfessor Ding-Geng (Din) Chen\nMember of the Academy of Science of South Africa\nFellow of the American Statistical Association\nSARChI Chair in Biostatistics (Tier 1) with NRF B1-Rating\nExtraordinary Professor, Department of Statistics, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa\nExecutive Director and Professor in Biostatistics, College of Health Solutions, Arizona State University, Phoenix, USA\n\nDon’t miss this opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methods in small area estimation from world-class experts!"
