    "text": "Strengthening (Bio)Statistics and Data Science Education and Research Resources in Sub-Saharan Africa\n\n\nJoin us for an engaging session focused on capacity building and research enhancement in biostatistics and data science at universities across sub-Saharan Africa. Over the years, significant investments have been made in higher education, training, and research. Traditionally, these partnerships have followed a North-South donor-recipient model. However, recent developments highlight the importance of integrating robust South-South collaborations to create more effective educational partnerships.\n\n\nThis session will showcase several ongoing initiatives supported by various organizations, emphasizing mutual North-South-South partnerships that have emerged in recent years. The presentations will cover four key topics that have fostered capacity building in biostatistics and data science across the region.\n\n\nSession Overview\n\n\nThe session will feature four 20-minute presentations:\n\n\n\nProf. Tobias Chirwa (University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa) will provide an overview of the SSACAB consortium, which aims to strengthen biostatistics education in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\nProf. Ann Mwangi (Moi University, Kenya) will discuss the long-term Moi-Brown collaboration focused on HIV biostatistics research training and capacity development activities.\n\n\nProf. Ziv Shkedy (Hasselt University, Belgium) will present an open-source E-learning platform, eR-Biostat, designed to support researchers, teachers, and students in statistics and data science.\n\n\nProf. Tarylee Reddy (SA-MRC, South Africa) will give an overview of the International Biometric Society’s (IBS) mentoring program and its activities in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\n\nThese initiatives exemplify diverse approaches to enhancing education and research in biostatistics and data science in sub-Saharan Africa. Each relies on strong collaborative networks and aims to produce sustainable deliverables that will remain accessible long after initial funding concludes.\n\n\nSession Details\n\n\n\nChair: Prof. Samuel Manda (University of Pretoria, South Africa)\n\n\nDiscussant: Prof. Misrak Gezmu (NIH, USA)\n\n\nDiscussion: A 30-minute discussion will follow, focusing on developing sustainable education and research pathways in the region.\n\n\n\nAll presenters, the chair, and the discussant are actively involved in long-term projects that promote education and research in (bio)statistics and data science within sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\nDon’t miss this opportunity to learn about impactful initiatives and contribute to the discussion on strengthening our educational resources!"
