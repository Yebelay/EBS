## Course Description
This intensive short course introduces essential skills in health data science, focusing on data wrangling and visualization using R. Participants will learn to clean, manipulate, and prepare health data for analysis, create compelling visualizations, and effectively communicate findings. Through hands-on exercises, students will gain practical experience with popular R packages such as `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, enabling them to transform complex datasets into clear insights. This course is ideal for beginners and healthcare professionals looking to enhance their data skills.

## Main Objectives
- **Understand the Role of Data Analysis:** Grasp how data analysis informs healthcare decisions and policies.
- **Foundational R Programming Skills:** Develop skills in R and become familiar with RStudio as a development environment.
- **Data Import and Export:** Learn efficient methods for importing and exporting data in various formats.
- **Data Manipulation with dplyr and tidyr:** Clean and manipulate health data by filtering, summarizing, and reshaping datasets.
- **Handling Missing Data:** Identify missing values and apply strategies for imputation to maintain data integrity.
- **Creating Visualizations with ggplot2:** Produce visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to effectively communicate insights.
- **Interpreting and Communicating Results:** Convey findings clearly to diverse audiences, emphasizing context and implications.
- **Case Studies in Health Data:** Apply learned techniques to real-world health data sets in public health and clinical practice.
- **Ethics in Data Presentation:** Understand the ethical implications, including privacy, bias, and responsible data use.
- **Continuous Learning:** Foster a mindset of continuous improvement, encouraging collaboration and providing resources for further study.
