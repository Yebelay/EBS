Course Description
</p>

- **Introduction to Linear Mixed Models:** Understand the framework and its advantages for analyzing data from designed experiments.

- **Progressive Development:** Start with simple linear models and gradually incorporate more complex fixed and random effects using Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation.

- **Complex Variance Structures:** Learn how to extend models to fit complex variance structures that account for dependencies over time and space.

- **Practical Sessions:** Engage in hands-on activities using the R statistical software package, allowing participants to analyze their own research data.
Who Should Attend?

This workshop is ideal for researchers and practitioners in biological sciences who are looking to enhance their data analysis skills using linear mixed models.
