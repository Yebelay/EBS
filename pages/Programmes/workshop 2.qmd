<p style="color: green; font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;">Course Description</p>

This short course introduces participants to the principles and techniques of geospatial mapping in health data science using R. Participants will learn to visualize and analyze spatial data to uncover health trends and disparities. The course covers essential topics such as data preparation, the use of geospatial packages like `sf` and `ggmap`, and creating informative maps to communicate findings effectively. Through hands-on exercises with real-world health datasets, students will gain the skills to integrate geographic information into their analyses, making this course ideal for public health professionals, researchers, and data enthusiasts interested in spatial analysis.

- Grasp fundamental concepts in geospatial analysis, including geographic data types, coordinate systems, and spatial relationships.
- Gain familiarity with R programming and relevant packages (`sf`, `sp`, `ggmap`) for handling and visualizing geospatial data.
- Learn to import, clean, and manipulate geospatial datasets for mapping and analysis.
- Master techniques for creating maps (e.g., choropleth, point, heatmaps) to communicate health-related information.
- Explore methods for identifying spatial patterns and trends in health data, such as clustering and hotspots.
- Learn to overlay additional datasets (e.g., demographic, environmental) on maps to enhance analysis.
- Develop skills to interpret map results and communicate findings to stakeholders and policymakers.
- Understand ethical issues in geospatial analysis, including privacy concerns and responsible data usage in health contexts.
- Apply learned techniques to real-world health datasets, working on case studies demonstrating the impact of spatial analysis on public health decisions.
- Foster a collaborative learning environment, encouraging participants to share insights and resources.
