Course Description
</p>

- **This applied workshop introduces practical strategies** for modeling longitudinal data with time-dependent covariates, using real-world examples from health, behavioral, and policy research.

- **Time-dependent covariates**—such as changing medication use, behavioral exposures, or symptom scores—pose unique challenges in longitudinal studies.

- **Participants will learn how to recognize and model** these variables using marginal models (e.g., GEE), mixed-effects models, and joint modeling frameworks.

- **Through a combination of lecture and live coding demonstrations**, the workshop will emphasize modeling approaches that address feedback, covariate timing, and dynamic exposure-outcome relationships.

- **Hands-on examples** will guide attendees through the implementation of these models in both SAS and R, with optional demonstrations using Stan for Bayesian extensions.

- **By the end of the workshop**, participants will be equipped to build, estimate, and interpret longitudinal models that incorporate time-dependent covariates in both continuous and binary outcome contexts.

Learning Objectives
</p>

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

1. Differentiate between time-independent and time-dependent covariates in longitudinal data.  
2. Understand the implications of using time-dependent covariates in marginal, conditional, and joint models.  
3. Identify situations involving feedback, endogeneity, and measurement timing.  
4. Implement marginal models using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and linear mixed-effects models.  
5. Fit models with time-dependent covariates using SAS and R.  
6. Interpret model results for time-varying effects and provide insight into dynamic change processes.
