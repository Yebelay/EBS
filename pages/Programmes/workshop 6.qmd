Course Description
</p>

- This course offers a basic area-level Small Area Estimation (SAE), which is used to provide reliable estimates by combining survey and census datasets for unplanned domains (local level administrations) when the sample sizes are small.

- One of the major challenges for low- and middle-income countries is the lack of data at the local administrative level in demographic and health survey (DHS) datasets. Therefore, this course will discuss how to handle this problem with SAE.

- The course starts from the fundamental principles of SAE and progresses to its advanced model extensions, including spatial, spatiotemporal, bivariate, and multivariate models.

- Another key component of the course is to explore the Generalized SAE (GSAE) approach, which builds upon the generalized direct survey estimates (GDESvy), incorporating the survey independent variables.

- Participants will learn the basic concepts of SAE, and its statistical model extensions in the Fay-Herriot model framework.

Learning Objectives
</p>

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

1. Briefly understand the basic concepts and principle of SAE.  
2. Learn about the extension models of SAE, including spatial, and spatiotemporal bivariate and multivariate models and examine how these extended models improved the SAE approach.  
3. Present the recently introduced concepts of GSAE and understand how incorporating independent survey variables can improve the results.  
4. Present how the generalized models, i.e., GSAE and GDESvy, improved the performance of the corresponding SAE and DESvy.
