Course Description
</p>

- This half-day workshop provides a comprehensive introduction to semiparametric joint modeling of competing risks survival and skewed longitudinal data using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach in R.

- The course is designed to offer computationally efficient Bayesian inference for complex biomedical follow-up data, where traditional MCMC techniques may be limited by high dimensionality, large dataset, or computational cost. 

- Participants will learn to flexibly model nonlinear longitudinal trajectories, accommodate skewed distributions and competing risks in survival processes, and link these components within a joint modeling frameworkâ€”incorporating smoothing splines, flexible distributions, and various association structures.

Learning Objectives
</p>

- Understand the basic concept of joint modelling of longitudinal and time-to-event data  
- Model nonlinear (skewed) longitudinal outcomes using semiparametric mixed-effects models with flexible distributional assumptions  
- Model survival data with competing risks failure times with flexible hazard shapes  
- Employ various association structures in joint modeling formulations  
- Approximate Bayesian inference using the INLA approach, INLAjoint in R  
- Evaluate the computational efficiency and estimation performance of INLA and MCMC
