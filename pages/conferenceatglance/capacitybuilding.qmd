  Strengthening (Bio)Statistics and Data Science Education and Research Resources in Sub-Saharan Africa
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
  Join us for an engaging session focused on capacity building and research enhancement in biostatistics and data science at universities across sub-Saharan Africa. Over the years, significant investments have been made in higher education, training, and research. Traditionally, these partnerships have followed a North-South donor-recipient model. However, recent developments highlight the importance of integrating robust South-South collaborations to create more effective educational partnerships.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
  This session will showcase several ongoing initiatives supported by various organizations, emphasizing mutual North-South-South partnerships that have emerged in recent years. The presentations will cover four key topics that have fostered capacity building in biostatistics and data science across the region.

  Session Overview
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
  The session will feature four 20-minute presentations:
</p>

<ul style="font-size: 1.1em;">
  <li><strong>Prof. Tobias Chirwa</strong> (University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa) will provide an overview of the <em>SSACAB consortium</em>, which aims to strengthen biostatistics education in sub-Saharan Africa.</li>
  <li><strong>Prof. Ann Mwangi</strong> (Moi University, Kenya) will discuss the long-term <em>Moi-Brown collaboration</em> focused on HIV biostatistics research training and capacity development activities.</li>
  <li><strong>Prof. Ziv Shkedy</strong> (Hasselt University, Belgium) will present an open-source E-learning platform, <em>eR-Biostat</em>, designed to support researchers, teachers, and students in statistics and data science.</li>
  <li><strong>Prof. Tarylee Reddy</strong> (SA-MRC, South Africa) will give an overview of the <em>International Biometric Society's (IBS)</em> mentoring program and its activities in sub-Saharan Africa.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
  These initiatives exemplify diverse approaches to enhancing education and research in biostatistics and data science in sub-Saharan Africa. Each relies on strong collaborative networks and aims to produce sustainable deliverables that will remain accessible long after initial funding concludes.
